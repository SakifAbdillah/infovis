Risk Assessment of QCL Process
- Cause/Effect Relationships are needed
- Analysis of high risk tasks
- recast checklist into a Risk Pareto Chart to identify high risk steps, forward and reverse FMEA

1. Data Driven QCL Process Remapping / Streamlining
– Revised Workflow and Task Due Dates
– Dedicated Task Coordination and Scheduling
2. Process Interlocks – No Fly Policy
– Rasmussen et al: timeouts at machine reduced mis-administrations by 3X [Med phys 2010)
– “Time Out” extended across process map
– Tx starts only after ALL QCLs are complete per defined timeline
– No last minute starts are allowed
– Cultural shift from ‘just in time’ to ‘cancel if not ready’

Standardized process:
•Multiple Handoffs Pivoted to Multiple Control Points
•Treatment Start is the Point of Confluence of All Tasks
•Stopping Rules Incorporated into Process Map

Results:
•Reduction in Computed Number of No Fly Events
•Most delays are currently proactive: Contouring delays, Plan Modifications, Scheduling Errors
•Reporting Efficiency Has Increased
